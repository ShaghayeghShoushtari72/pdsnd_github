### Bike Share Data
Bikeshare Data Analysis.
Over the past decade, **bicycle-sharing** systems have been growing in *number* and *popularity* in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Description
In this project, we want to analyse the bikeshare data collected from three major cities; Chicago, Washington, and New York.
Here, we analyse various statistics such as: 
* most common travel time, most popular stations.
* total and averge travel duration and so on.

  We also have the option of viewing the data table in chunks of five lines, or at once.
  
### Files used
* bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
* new_your_city.csv
